This score is really great... too great. I was wondering whether there was possible data leakage. Overall, I filled one column containing 8000 NaNs, another one containing 7000 NaNs, and a third one containing 6000 NaNs, fourth containing 5000 NaNs, and lastly a fifth containing 3,400 NaNs. The data set is of size ~110,000 so I wonder if the data leakaged occured there.
